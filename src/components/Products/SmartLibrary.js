              It has been manâ€™s continual quest to be able to access all the
              records of human intellectual appeared anywhere, which might be of
              interest to him. Libraries are always being social institutions.
              They offer public access to information and knowledge representing
              diverse source and view point. But access to public knowledge, in
              traditional libraries, was limited to those who could travel to
              physical site of that library.

              Access to library collection for remote users has long been a
              challenge for librarians. For centuries, they have managed
              warehouse of documents by acquiring, cataloguing and classifying
              books, journals and other materials and circulating them to their
              clientele. But computer and communication technologies have
              improved the new breed of information professionals to select,
              organize, retrieve and transfer digital content effectively and
              efficiently to the users Advancement in information and
              communication technologies (ICTs) has changed the concept of
              library as a physical artifact to digital library as a library
              without walls.

          <ScrollAnimation animateIn="fadeIn">
            <p>
              The terms, electronic library, digital library and virtual library
              have been used interchangeably and now widely accepted as a
              description of the use of digital technology by libraries to
              acquire, store, conserve and make available their content to
              remote users. In a broad sense, a digital library may be treated
              as an organized and managed collection of highly quality
              information content in a variety of media (text, still image,
              moving image, sound but all in digital forms, accessible over
              different electronic networks The concept of digital library is
              routed in the age-old dream of creating a virtual library. The
              main component of a virtual library is a vast, ideally universal
              collection of information and instantaneous access to that
              information wherever it physically resides but digital library is
              different form virtual library because of its physical
              identification in some aspects.

            <p>
              Digital libraries, like traditional ones, select, acquire,
              catalogue, make available, and preserve collections. A digital
              library contains digital representation of the objects found in
              it, and will be accessible via Internet, though not necessarily to
              everyone. But the idea of digitization is perhaps the only
              characteristic of a digital library on which there is universal
              agreement. The common characteristics in the various definitions
              of digital library, identified by Association of Research are as
              follows:

              Contents in a digital library are organized and managed for the
              purpose of immediate access to the target audience. How contents
              are developed and managed, is a critical issue to the long term
              success of digital library services, especially when technical
              resources are limited. Content management includes the following
              key functions
